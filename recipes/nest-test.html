    Adding a class to the html tag works, but only the specified descendent combinators apply.
    The results are that only sections being the correct style.
    Best to include a cass in the html tag for the stylesheet with descendant combinators of all relevant tags. 
    This prevents the need for many smaller tags.

    <h1>Nest Test<h1>
    <h2>This is not directly nested under .inverse-blue.</h2>
    <h3>It should have yellow text with a blue background</h4>
    <h4>This line should do the same.</h4>
    <p>This line, too, has a &lt;body&gt; element between it and the ancestor and should be using the .inverse-blue color scheme.</p>
    <p style="color: #0B96C4; text-decoration: underline;">This line should be blue, like in index.html. I gave it inline styling specifically so it applies the original style (I couldn't get class selectors to override .inverse-blue using CSS Cascade).<p>
