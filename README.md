Creating a basic recipe website to incorporate html skills.

At the end of this project I should be able to demonstrate skills including:
- Creating an html boilerplate from scratch
- Setting up links properly
- Setting up images properly
- Demonstrating an understanding of various html tags, and some of their attributes, namely:
	- <p> along with <strong> and <em>, <img> with attributes "src" and "alt", and <a> along with the "href" attribute.
