Creating a basic recipe website to incorporate html skills.

At the end of this project I should be able to demonstrate skills including:
- Creating an html boilerplate from scratch
- Setting up links properly
- Setting up images properly
- Demonstrating an understanding of various html tags, and some of their attributes, namely:
	- &lt;p&gt; along with &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags, &lt;img&gt; tags with attributes <strong>src</strong> and <strong>alt</strong>, and finally &lt;a&gt; tags along with the <strong>href</strong> attribute.
